# Project-Aloha

This project is one of my first real web development projects. There were a lot of learning curves to get over, but in the end,
I am proud of my work. 

I used a combination of HTML5 and CSS3 to build this project. I was supplied with a design and I had to implement it with the 
designer's vision in mind. 

Completing this project helped me learn a lot more about CSS3 and HTML5. I was able to use flexbox to position my content, which 
I had never previously used. I have found that flexbox works much better for accurate positioning than just using floats. I will
definitely be using it from now on, in place of always using the Box Model. 

I also added in a couple of media queries, which is another new element to me. I am still learning
how to use them to implement a completely responsive design. For now, however, I have used them to get a feel for how they work.

I am looking forward to building on this project and making it into a responsive design.
